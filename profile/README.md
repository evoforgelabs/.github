# 🔬 EvoForgeLabs

**Building intelligent bridges between software and silicon**

---

## Who We Are

EvoForgeLabs is an academic research initiative developing a **chip-aware instrumentation platform** that enables seamless interfacing, programming, and testing of integrated circuits[web:32][web:33].

### 🎯 Our Mission

Creating a unified hardware/software ecosystem that abstracts the complexity of IC interaction through intelligent automation and standardized chip description frameworks[web:33].

---

## 🚀 What We're Building

**Core Project:** A modular FPGA-based platform that can:
- Interface with diverse ICs (audio codecs, DACs, motor drivers)
- Auto-generate drivers from chip datasheets
- Provide real-time configuration and testing capabilities
- Enable rapid prototyping through hardware abstraction

**Target ICs:** TAC5212, AD9152, MCF8329A-Q1, and extensible to others.
